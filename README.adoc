= escm - Embedded Scheme Processor

This repository is converted from the CVS repo of link:https://practical-scheme.net/vault/escm.html[escm].
This is made available mainly for historical interest.

We have two modules here:

- link:escm-1[]: The 'original' `escm` - a simple text preprocessor that converts
  markups in the source into Scheme expression; you can pipe the output to
  Scheme interpreter (such as link:https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/[Gauche]) to obtain the fully-expanded output.
- link:escm[]: The enhanced version, `aescm` - it supports not only Scheme but
  a dozen more languages.
