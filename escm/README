   This is README file for aescm 0.20 (README or doc/readme.html).

   Aescm is an experimental version of escm. The stable version is still escm
   1.1.

   Aescm is a filter program to preprocesses embedded Scheme code in
   documents like eperl or eruby. Scheme code between <?scm and ?> is
   evaluated and replaced with what is written to (current-output-port) while
   the evaluation. An expression between <?scm:d and ?> is evaluated and
   replaced with the result.

   The body of aescm is a simple converter from a text to Scheme code, which
   will be sent to a Scheme interpreter. Because of this architecture, it
   works with most implementations.

INSTALLATION

   If your favorite interpreter is Gauche or if it is Guile and you have not
   installed Gauche, then type as usual:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

   If it is not the case, you should specify the interpreter and its option
   arguments for a batch mode when you run configure script. The options for
   some implementations are listed in doc/interpreter.html.

   Suppose your choice be scheme -s /dev/stdin. Then run as:

 ./configure --with-backend="scheme -s /dev/stdin"

   You can also embed other interpreter languages than Scheme if you run
   configure with --enable-polyglot option. See doc/gimmick.html for detail.

   This program can be used as a handler CGI program of Apache web servers.
   The tool will be automatically installed in cgi-bin directory. You may
   have to add a suffix. Consult the example in the man page.

BUGS

   This is an experimental version and not thoroughly tested. So it must be
   buggy.

   If you have found bugs, please inform of them via the bug track system in
   sourceforge's escm project page or email (tagga@tsuda.ac.jp).
