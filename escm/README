   This is README file for aescm 0.20 (README or doc/readme.html).

   Aescm is an experimental version of escm. The stable version is still escm
   1.1.

   Seemingly aescm is a filter program to processes embedded Scheme code in
   documents like ePerl or eRuby. In fact it converts documents into Scheme
   code and make it evaluated by a backend Scheme interpreter. Scheme code
   between <?scm and ?> is evaluated and replaced with what is written to
   stdout while the evaluation. Code between <?scm:d and ?> is evaluated and
   replaced with the result.

   Aescm is designed to be interpreter independent, and works with most
   Scheme implementations.

INSTALL

   Find out good option arguments for your favorite scheme interprter before
   running configure script. Options for some implementations are documented
   in doc/interpreter.html.

   Suppose your choice be scheme -s /dev/stdin. Then type:

 ./configure --with-backend="scheme -s /dev/stdin"
 make
 make install

   You can enable to embed other interpreter languages than Scheme by
   specifying --enable-gimmick option. The distribution comes with the
   configuration files for Awk, Csh, Perl, Python, Ruby, Sh, and Tcl. See
   doc/gimmick.html for detail.

   You can also use this program as an action handler of Apache. You should
   intall it manually if you want to. Consult the example in the man page.

BUGS

   This is an experimental version and not thoroughly tested. So it must be
   buggy.

   If you have found bugs, please inform of them via the bug track system in
   sourceforge's escm project page or email (tagga@tsuda.ac.jp).
